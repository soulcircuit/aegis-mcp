# Aegis Documentation Hub

This directory contains all assets, protocols, templates, and logs related to the Aegis Mutuality Protocol and its integration within the MoonRE project.

## Contents

- **Aegis Mutuality Protocol**
  - `Aegis_Mutuality_Protocol_v0.5.md`: The living protocol document.
- **Quickfix Research & Review**
  - `Aegis_Quickfix_Review_Template.md`: Canonical template for rapid, multi-agent review cycles.
  - `quickfix_embed_aegis_core.md`: Example/live quickfix review for embedding Aegis essence in core prompts.

## Purpose

Centralize all Aegis-related documentation for clarity, maintainability, and ease of reference. All other project documentation (API, schema, training, etc.) remains in their respective subfolders under `docs/`.

## Migration Note

If you are looking for Aegis protocol, quickfix, or insight log files, they have been moved here from the root of `docs/` for better organization.
